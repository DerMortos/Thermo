% The rate of heat transfer between a certain electric motor and its surroundings
% varies with time as
% 
% Q_dot =  -0.2[1 -exponent(-0.05*t)
% 
% where t is in seconds andÌ‡ Q_dot is in kW. The shaft of the motor rotates at a 
% constant speed of omega = 100 rad/s (about 955 revolutions per minute, or RPM) and 
% applies a constant torque of tau = 18 N * m to an external load. The motor draws
% a constant electric power input equal to 2.0 kW. For the motor, plot Q_dot and
% W_dot, each in kW,and the change in energy deltaE, in kJ, as functions of time from t = 0
% to t = 120 s. Discuss
